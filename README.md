# React Redux Matching Game

This project is a card matching game built with React and Redux. The game board is a set of cards, each with a word related to Redux. The goal of the game is to match pairs of cards with the same word.

## Game Components

The game consists of two main components:

1. `Card`: This component represents a single card on the board. It uses Redux hooks to dispatch actions and access the state of the game. It handles the logic for flipping cards and matching pairs of cards.

2. `Board`: This component represents the game board. It uses the `Card` component to render the cards on the board.

## Redux Store

The state of the game is managed with Redux. The store contains the state of the board, which is an array of card objects. Each card has an `id`, `contents`, `visible`, and `matched` property.

The Redux slice for the game includes:

- Actions for setting the board, flipping a card, and resetting the cards.
- A reducer that handles these actions and updates the state of the game accordingly.
- Selectors for accessing the board and the IDs of the visible and matched cards from the state.

## Running the Game

To run the game, navigate to the project directory and run `npm start`. This will start the game in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Testing

To run the tests for the game, navigate to the project directory and run `npm test`.

## Building for Production

To build the game for production, navigate to the project directory and run `npm run build`. This will create a `build` folder with the production-ready files.
